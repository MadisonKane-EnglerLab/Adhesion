# Codes and how they were used for analysis in "Adhesion Strength of Tumor Cells Predicts Metastatic Disease in vivo" manuscript

# Matlab files to use for in vitro cell line data or cells retrieved from mouse samples




# Matlab files used for human patient sample data
# The main script to generate adhesion curves for individual microscope slides/technical replicates is "ShearAnalysis_rev14_HumanPatientData.m". To run script "fancyplot.m", "readnd2.m", and "ComsolShears.m" are needed in file directory as they are called in "ShearAnalysis_rev14_HumanPatientData.m".
